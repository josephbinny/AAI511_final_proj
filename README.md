# AAI511_final_proj

This is the final assignment for AAI-511 Neural Networks and Deep Learning course, summer 2023.  
We used midi files with music from classical composers, e.g., Mozart, Chopin, Batch, etc.  
Our goal is to classify the composer based on the song.  
We experimented with and used LSTM and CNN.
